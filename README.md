# Windows10Fixer
This is a batch file I created because I needed an easy and effective way of cleaning up my Windows 10 setup. This is my first actual working program and I hope to create more in the future. (Probably not anymore batch files though) 

I got a lot of insperation from W4RH4WK to create this file. While powershell is really fun to program in I wanted something a little simpler (albiet less powerful) to easly change settings in Windows 10. I would highly recommed anyone wanting to learn more about powershell to check out his GitHub.

In the future I would like to take this into the GUI realm using C++ or some other language to fully realize this program. I think it would be very benificial for me to learn those kinds of languages as well as the old DOS language. 

There are undos if you mess up for most of the settings, so don't worry about that.

In the future I have no clue what Microsoft is planning with Windows 10 so be prepared if this program doesn't work in the future. 

I created this for me and those that aren't really tech-savvy and like to have some words and buttons to press.
