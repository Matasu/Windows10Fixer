# Windows10Fixer
This is a batch file I created because I needed an easy and effective way of cleaning up my Windows 10 setup. This is my first actual working program and I hope to create more in the future. (Probably not anymore batch files though) 

I got a lot of inspiration from W4RH4WK to create this file. While PowerShell is really fun to program in I wanted something a little simpler (albeit less powerful) to easily change settings in Windows 10. I would highly recommend anyone wanting to learn more about PowerShell to check out his GitHub.

In the future, I would like to take this into the GUI realm using C++ or some other language to fully realize this program. I think it would be very beneficial for me to learn those kinds of languages as well as the old DOS language. 

You can undo things if you mess up for most of the settings, so don't worry about that.

In the future, I have no clue what Microsoft is planning with Windows 10 so be prepared if this program doesn't work in the future. 

I created this for me and those that aren't really tech-savvy and like to have words and buttons to press. 

# Usage
Just click on the file that ends with .bat. Boom! Good job you did it!

# Problems/Bugs/Issues
I have no clue if there are any yet because I've been the only one to use this program.

# Plans
I plan on finishing this thing because as of right now there are still many things I have to do to get this program flushed out. 
The first step is to finalize my GitHub page and finish typing all of these READMEs.
